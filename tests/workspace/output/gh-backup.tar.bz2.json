I chose sane defaults.. mainly focused on the use-case for resuming interrupted downloads.. but it's all right there.. so a user can tweak the settings as needed.\n\nin this commit, 'wget' is currently the only supported download utility.\n\nimmediately after this tagged release, there's going to be a branch named 'replay/curl' added.\nI've already written an implementation to support 'curl', however there's a bit of a snag.. that I'll discuss in greater detail when that commit is made; the issue has to do with how 'curl' uses the `current working directory`.. and our inability to assign it.\n\nsufficed to say, adding additional download tools is pretty straight forward.. and the commit that adds 'curl' will serve as a roadmap for exactly where all the touch-points are.\n\nas for 'curl' itself.. and bringing that utility into `master`.. the concept of using a default download directory is going to need to be revisited/reworked. If the main use-case is resuming broken downloads.. then it would be a nice feature to offer the user the option (when selecting which saved requests to replay) whether or not (for each download) to interactively locate an existing file on the file system.. that the download utility will append additional data onto. This way, tools (like 'wget') that can use a default download directory will give the user the option to either:\n- \"replay\" several saved requests in bulk, and silently (re)download the files to a single predefined directory without requiring any user interaction, _or_\n- be prompted (for each download) to identify the filepath where the original/partial file lives\n\n..which is awesome functionality!\nAdditionally, it would allow using 'curl'.. if only in this \"interactive\" mode.\n\nI should probably say a lot more about this release.. it's a huge step forward..\n\nI'll most likely add to this description tomorrow. For right now, I want to push the 'curl' branch (and get a little rest).\n",
